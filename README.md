## üõ†Ô∏è COVID-19 Data Processing & Analysis with NumPy  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Preprocessing** ([CODE data_preprocessing](https://github.com/NhutVuong/Covid-19_Processing_by_Numpy-Pandas/blob/main/Code_numpy/Code_numpy/Tien_xu_ly_du_lieu.ipynb))
   - Cleaning and structuring raw data  
   - Handling missing values  
   - **Converting textual data into numerical format** for easier analysis
     
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Trend Analysis, Statistics & Country Comparisons** ([CODE trend_analysis_statistics](https://github.com/NhutVuong/Covid-19_Processing_by_Numpy-Pandas/blob/main/Code_numpy/Code_numpy/Phan_tich_xu_huong_dich_benh.ipynb))  
   - Calculate total **Confirmed cases, Deaths, and Recovered cases**  
   - Identify peak infection days  
   - Perform statistical analysis (mean, variance, standard deviation)  
   - **Compare data across countries** (total Confirmed cases, Deaths, Recovery rates)  
   - Identify countries with the highest/lowest Recovery rates  

**This project leverages the power of NumPy** to efficiently process and analyze COVID-19 data **without relying on libraries like Pandas.**  

## üõ†Ô∏è COVID-19 Data Processing & Analysis with Pandas  

This project utilizes **Pandas** to efficiently process and analyze COVID-19 data. With Pandas, we can handle large datasets, clean missing values, perform aggregations, and extract meaningful insights with ease.  

### üîπ Key Features:  
- Load and preprocess data from CSV files  
- Handle missing values and format data  
- Perform statistical analysis on **Confirmed cases, Deaths, and Recoveries**  
- Group, filter, and visualize trends over time  
- Compare COVID-19 impact across different countries  

[CODE pandas_processing](https://github.com/NhutVuong/Covid-19_Processing_by_Numpy-Pandas/blob/main/Code_pandas/Code_pandas.ipynb)

By leveraging **Pandas**, we enhance data processing capabilities and gain deeper insights into the pandemic.  

## üîç Summary & Conclusion  

This project demonstrates two different approaches to processing and analyzing COVID-19 data:  
- **NumPy:** Used for numerical operations and direct array-based data processing.  
- **Pandas:** Used for structured data manipulation, cleaning, and statistical analysis.  

Both approaches provide valuable insights, but **Pandas offers more flexibility** when working with real-world datasets, especially those with mixed data types (numbers & text).  

By comparing these methods, we better understand the strengths of each library and how to choose the right tool for data analysis tasks.
